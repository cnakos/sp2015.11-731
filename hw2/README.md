11-731 Machine Translation HW #2

Due to time constraints (read: poor allocation), I only implemented the baseline, simple version of METEOR.  I messed with various variations on Levenshtein distance, including character-based, word-based, and truncated word-based, but only character-based Levenshtein produced reasonable results, and these were about on par with simple METEOR.

I began exploring POS tagging, but technical difficulties with Python/Java short-circuited this exploration.
