11-731 Machine Translation HW #2

Due to time constraints (read: poor allocation), I only implemented the baseline, simple version of METEOR with exact matching, stemming, and synonymy aligned in separate rounds.  The final version also includes a fragmentation penalty but makes no attempt to minimize crossings while aligning.  I also toyed with various variations on Levenshtein distance, including character-based, word-based, and truncated word-based, but only character-based Levenshtein produced reasonable results, and these were about on par with simple METEOR.  I began exploring POS tagging using the NLTK, but technical difficulties with Python/Java short-circuited this exploration.
