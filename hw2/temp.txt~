Sure, try to following in Python:

import os
from nltk.parse import stanford
os.environ['STANFORD_PARSER'] = '/folder/with/standford/jars'
os.environ['STANFORD_MODELS'] = '/folder/with/standford/jars'

parser = stanford.StanfordParser(model_path="/location/of/the/englishPCFG.ser.gz")
sentences = parser.raw_batch_parse(("Hello, My name is Melroy.", "What is your name?"))
print sentences

# GUI
for sentence in sentences:
    sentence.draw()

Output:

    [Tree('ROOT', [Tree('S', [Tree('INTJ', [Tree('UH', ['Hello'])]), Tree(',', [',']), Tree('NP', [Tree('PRP$', ['My']), Tree('NN', ['name'])]), Tree('VP', [Tree('VBZ', ['is']), Tree('ADJP', [Tree('JJ', ['Melroy'])])]), Tree('.', ['.'])])]), Tree('ROOT', [Tree('SBARQ', [Tree('WHNP', [Tree('WP', ['What'])]), Tree('SQ', [Tree('VBZ', ['is']), Tree('NP', [Tree('PRP$', ['your']), Tree('NN', ['name'])])]), Tree('.', ['?'])])])]

Note 1: In this example both the parser & model jars are in the same folder.

Note 2:

    File name of stanford parser is: stanford-parser.jar
    File name of stanford models is: stanford-parser-x.x.x-models.jar

Note 3: The englishPCFG.ser.gz file can be found inside the models.jar file (/edu/stanford/nlp/models/lexparser/englishPCFG.ser.gz). Please use come archive manager to 'unzip' the models.jar file.

Note 4: Be sure you are using Java JRE (Runtime Environment) 1.8 also known as Oracle JDK 8. Otherwise you will get: Unsupported major.minor version 52.0.

EDITED:

    Download the latest version from (current version is called stanford-parser-full-2014-10-31): http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml#Download

    The stanford-parser-3.5.0-models.jar file is located in the root of the downloaded zip file. Again browse inside the models.jar file to: /edu/stanford/nlp/models/lexparser/, in order to find the englishPCFG.ser.gz file. Extract this file and remember the location of this ser.gz file.

    Create new folder called 'jars'.

    Place the stanford-parser.jar, stanford-parser-3.4.1-sources.jar and stanford-parser-3.4.1-javadoc.jar in the 'jars' folder.

    As shown above you can use the environment variables (STANFORD_PARSER & STANFORD_MODELS) to point to this 'jars' folder. I'm using Linux, so if you use Windows please use something like: C://folder//jars.

    When creating a StanfordParser instance, you can provide the model path as parameter. So give the complete model path to the ser.gz as shown above.

    Now you are ready to run the example script.
